# InspectOMOP

---

## What is it?

**inspectomop** is a lightweight python package designed to assist data scientists with running queries against databases following the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model.  

## Why was this built?

A large portion of data science research is spent on ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading).  During the extraction phase if the data is stored in a relational database this involves writing SQL queries to gather information specific to the research question at hand.  

A large portion of research in data science involves data munging; the process of taking raw data in one format and transforming it to a more suitable form for downstream tasks.
