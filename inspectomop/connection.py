        Executes an SQL query on the OMOP CDM.

        Parameters
        ----------
        statement : sqlalchemy object or string
            sqlalchemy objects - statements can be created using sqlalchemy objects such as select, insert, etc. and the underlying table structures from Inspector.tables
                e.g. select([concept]).where(concept.concept_id==0)
            strings - can be a string containing an SQL statement such as
                e.g. 'SELECT concept_name from concept where concept_id = 0'

        Returns
        -------
        results : inspectomop.Results
            The results object is a subclass of sqlalchemy.engine.CursorResult with extra methods for retrieving the results as
            pandas DataFrames.  Traditional methods conforming to the python DB connection spec work as well e.g. fetchone, fetchmany, fetchall

        Notes
        -----
            *** Use of raw SQL strings is not recommended as they bypass the dialect translation and security
            provided by using SQLAlchemy ***
